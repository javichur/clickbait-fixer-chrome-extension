## Key features

1. Scans the links of any website, and **marks the clickbaits in red and the headlines that are not clickbait in green**. To do this, it uses a local AI API (**Prompt API**).
2. Based on the number of clickbaits on the website, it generates a **clickbait score for that website**. The score will be a value between 0 (all links are clickbaits) and 100 (no clickbaits).
3. It adds an **awesome tooltip to each link**, with the following information: **why it is or is not clickbait; and a non-clickbait alternative headline suggestion**.
4. You read that right! The non-clickbait alternative title suggestion is generated by automatically **downloading the link destination and summarizing it locally** (**Summarization API**).
5. You can use the **Extension icon (popup)** to scan all the links in the current web; **or just click right over a link** and select the Clickbait fixer option in the **context menu** to analyze only that link.
